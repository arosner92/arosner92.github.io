    <p>I am from California. Born and raised in Norcal until I was 11 and then moved to Socal until I graduated high school. Went on a year abroad program in Israel and then moved to Georgia where my parents had just moved to. Went to college and here I am today in a Data Science Bootcamp.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include exercise and my passion is health and wellness. I spend my free time with my dog, Boujee, and my wife, Maryana.</p>
